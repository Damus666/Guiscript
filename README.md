# Guiscript WIP

User friendly, script based UI library for pygame graphical user interfaces.<br>
The scripting is similar to CSS, the syntax is simple and the UI can be used for both applications and games.<br>
The library offers lots of customization and helpful tools like callbacks, buffers, pygame events and built in animations.<br>
The library comes with lots of default elements and styles that are easily expandable by the user.<br>
It aims to be easy to use and pygame friendly with freedom of game loop.<br>
It revolves around user responsible changes and good performance for games.<br>
The elements structure is easy to follow thanks to the use of context managers.<br>
Customization is easily accessible thanks to the styling and style priority and inheritance system.
